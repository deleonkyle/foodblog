  <center><h1>Filipino Food</h1></center>
  <p><center>The history of Filipino food also goes along with the history of the Philippines as a nation. Filipino food is indeed a gastronomic telling of Philippine history. As a country surrounded by water and islands blessed with fertile soil, early Filipinos ventured out in the sea for a rich catch, into muddy rice paddies to plant rice or into the woods to hunt for abundant wildlife. The harvest and catch were cooked in simple manner: boiled, steamed, roasted or broiled over an open fire.

Trade with other Asian nations introduced a number of enhancements into Philippine cuisine, most notably toyo (soy sauce) and patis (fish sauce), as well as the method of stir frying and making savory soup bases. Vinegar and spices were then used in foods to preserve them.

The Chinese who came to trade and brought their own ways of cooking. Many of them married locals and introduced their dishes, and thus Filipino-Chinese food came to be. The names identify them: pancit are noodles that come in various forms such as bihon, Canton, miki or sotanghon; lumpia are vegetables rolled in edible wrappers; siopao are steamed, filled buns; siomai are dumplings.

When Spanish came, Filipinos were exposed to a flair for rich food, the way Europeans chose to prepare it. Stews such as the cocido and puchero, rice-meat dishes and elaborate desserts such as brazos, and tortas imperiales are generally considered fiesta food, and most often found on the dining tables of the upper classes. The food influences they brought were from both Spain and Mexico, notably as the Philippines became part of the galleon trade.


 
Popular cuisines the Spaniards introduced into the Filipino tables include paella, the dish cooked in the fields by Spanish workers, came to be a festive dish combining pork, chicken, seafood, ham, sausages and vegetables. Relleno, the process of stuffing festive capons and turkeys for Christmas, was applied to chicken, and even to bangus, the Philippine milkfish.</center></p>

<h2><center>PORK SISIG RECIPE</h2>
<p>Want to learn how to cook that known pig’s face pulutan? Try this sisig recipe and enjoy the party!
Sisig is widely known among Filipinos, not just as an appetizer or a pulutan (accompaniment to alcoholic drinks), but as a main dish. The Kapampangan term “sisig” means “to snack on something sour”, which usually refers to fruit, often unripe or half-ripe, sometimes dipped in salt and vinegar. The term could also be the method of preparing fish and meat, which is marinated in a sour liquid, such as lemon juice or vinegar, then seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices. This dish here, sisig, is a Filipino dish made from parts of pig’s head and liver, which is usually seasoned with calamansi and chili peppers.
Preparing sisig involves boiling of the head to remove hairs and tenderize it, and broiling or grilling of some portions. Chopped onions are added as being served on a sizzling plate. Throughout the years, variations exist, which added eggs, liver, and mayonnaise among others. This delicacy originated from Pampanga; Lucia Cunanan of Angeles City invented it. Currently, Angeles City is known as the “Sisig Capital of the Philippines”. Annually, “Sisig Festival” is being held in the city during the month of December to celebrate this dish. So, want to cook your own sisig? Try the recipe below and maybe you can be part of this year’s sisig cooking competition in the festival. Enjoy! </p>

<h1><center>Japanese Food</h1>
<p> The biggest influence on Japanese cuisine by far has been the introduction of rice into Japanese culture.  Around 2000 B.C., China and the Korean Peninsula introduced rice to Japan.  This happened during the Jomon period, which stretched from 14 000 B.C to 300 B.C. However, during this time, rice was not a staple in the diets of Japanese people. Even though it was periodically consumed, it was not a major part of Japanese cuisine. Also, there were no full-time rice farmers during that time. Japanese people were mostly hunters, gatherers, and fishers. Unlike the Middle East and other Asian countries at that time, Japanese civilians did not feel much pressure to become full-time farmers.

                However, nearing the end of the Jomon period, Japanese society changed from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agricultural lifestyle. At about 300 B.C. widespread rice cultivation in Japan began. Because of the rice introduced to Japan by China through the Korean Peninsula, rice became a staple. Quickly, rice became a major part of Japanese worldview. It became Japan’s most important crop. At one time, it was even used as currency. The Japanese word for cooked rice is “gohan”, which translates to “meal”.  The fact that rice means “meal” in Japanese shows just how important this crop turned out to be. Also, the Japanese word for breakfast is “asagohan”, which translates to “morning rice”.  Rice was enjoyed by all classes. Whether it is the peasants or the noblemen, everybody ate rice.

                Approximately 500 years after the change to an agricultural lifestyle, China and the Korean Peninsula introduced Chinese culture into Japanese society. This was during the Kofun Period which lasted from 250 B.C to 500 B.C. The religious practice of Buddhism became important in Japanese society. In the 6th century, nearing the end of the Kofun Period, Japan sought to fully imitate Chinese culture during the Tang Dynasty.  Therefore in 675 AD, Emperor Temmu issued a decree on the prohibition of eating various animals such as horses, dogs, monkeys, cattle, and chickens during the 4th-9th month of each year. This law was punishable by death.  However, Temmu did not ban deer or wild boar since they were essential in maintaining a Japanese diet. </p>

    <center><h2>Takoyaki Recipe たこ焼き </h2></center>
    <p>It originated and became popular in Osaka around 1935 (according to wiki) and then spread to greater south-central Japan and beyond.
It’s one of the most popular Japanese street foods along with Okonomiyaki.
Takoyaki is usually sold by street vendors, convenience stores, supermarkets, food courts, and of course specialty restaurants. In Osaka, takoyaki stands can be easily found throughout the city.
It is usually served with slightly salty takoyaki sauce, which goes well with beer and other alcoholic drinks. Therefore, many Izakaya restaurants serve takoyaki on the menu.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <p>There are so many variations of takoyaki throughout Japan. For example, the original Osaka-style does not include any cabbage, but many regional variations (Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, Tokyo areas) do. Even though I lived in the Tokyo area, I actually didn’t know they sometimes contain cabbage till now.
Here are ingredients for classic takoyaki recipe. 
</p>


<ul>
<li>Dashi-flavored batter
Very simple. It’s a mixture of Japanese stock Dashi, all-purpose flour, baking powder, eggs, salt, and soy sauce. If you don’t want to make the batter from scratch, you can find takoyaki mix in Japanese grocery stores or Amazon.</li>

<li> Octopus
You can purchase cooked (boiled) octopus (tako in Japanese) in Japanese grocery stores. If you are going to make this snack for a big party, you can purchase a whole cooked octopus at an online sashimi store like Catalina Offshore. When I buy a whole octopus, I use it for different dishes, including sashimi, carpaccio, octopus salad (Takosu), and of course, takoyaki.</li>

<li>Beni shoga (pickled red ginger)
Small bits of beni shoga, or red pickled ginger, give a nice pop on the color of takoyaki and a little spicy, pungent kick to the dish.</li>

<li> Green onion
The batter is yellow, octopus, and beni shoga are red… and now you need green color to make the dish look more appetizing (and delicious)!</li>

<li>Tenkasu or Agedama (Tempura scraps)
I often get questions about what Tenkasu does for the dish. We use tempura scraps for hot or cold Tanuki Udon Noodles and Okonomiyaki (even Hiroshima-style). The oil from Tenkasu adds richer and umami flavors, and additional crispness and creaminess inside takoyaki balls.</li>
</ul>
 <h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol> 
<li>Use LOTS of oil.
Apply generous oil everywhere (each hole in the takoyaki pan and surrounding flat area). How generous? You should see 1/4 inch (5 mm) oil in each hole. The oil helps takoyaki to have crispy skin and it’ll be easier for you to flip without the batter being stuck. </li>

<li>Generously pour the batter.
When you see smoke coming out of the grill/plate, fill the hole with the batter. If it overflows, that’s okay. Because the entire grill top should be covered with the batter after adding octopus and other ingredients in the hole. If you use a bigger chunk of octopus pieces, you might want to pour just enough to the top of the holes. As soon as the octopus goes in, it overflows naturally.</li>

<li>Flip 90 degrees and stuff in the extra batter.
Break the extra batter around the hole with skewers. Once the bottom of takoyaki balls are crispy, rotate 90 degrees to let the uncooked batter pour out into the hole. Stuff and push in the extra surrounding dough inside the balls. This will help make a perfectly round shape.</li>

<h1><center>Korean Food</h1>
  <p>Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions and practices of the culinary arts of Korea. Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.[1][2]

Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, and (at least in the South) meats. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochutgaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional[3] dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.
Japan colonized Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Many of the agricultural systems were taken over by the Japanese to support Japan's food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during this period to support the Japanese Empire's war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of other grains for their own consumption.[15]

Meals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice each year, while the remainder of the year was filled with cheaper grains, such as millet and barley.[16] For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.[17]

The country remained in a state of turmoil through the Korean War (1950–1953) and the Cold War, which separated the country into North Korea and South Korea. Both of these periods continued the limited food provisions for Koreans,[15] and the stew called budae jjigae, which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage and Spam, originated during this period.

At this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged. In the 1960s under President Park Chung-hee, industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. Livestock and dairy production was increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms.[18] The consumption of pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6 kg in 1961 and 11 kg by 1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of bulgogi restaurants, which gave the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching 40 kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5 kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these years, with 128 kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106 kg in 1995 and 83 kg in 2003. The decrease in rice consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles.</p>
