<h1>MEET JOMAR</h1>
 <img src="x.jpeg" alt="bulaloman" style="width:60%">
 <h1> The Blog</h1> 
 <p>Welcome to my kitchen! I am Jomar Diong and the food blogger behind Kusina ni Jomar. The blog launched in 2012 as a place to share my passion for cooking. I love trying new things and testing them out with my family. Each recipe is tried and true, family-tested and approved. Inspired by cookbooks, other food blogs, magazines, and family recipes, I try to make practical and easy family friendly recipes on my site that can bring your family together at the dinner table.

Nestled in Philippines, I spend all of my free time being a busy husband and father of four children. They can be my toughest critics when it comes to the food that I make. They especially enjoy cooking in the kitchen with me and helping to create delicious recipes to share.

</p>
<h1>Wanna Work with me?</h1>
<p>The Kusina ni Jomar is one of the fastest and largest growing Filipino food blogs reaching well over 10 million readers each month. Kusina ni Jomar’s aggregate social sites have a reach over 30 million readers each week. Combining the sites vast reach and influence with high quality tested recipes, professional photography, and the editorial content will take your brand recognition to a new level.</p>
<h1> How I get Started</h1>
<p>
I started actually trying to cook back in 2005 (I was REALLY good at making toast) and baking didn’t come for me until 2008, and let me tell you, before that time I was completely lost in the kitchen! Yep, I said it! I never dreamed that I would end up with a major cooking/baking obsession.  When I started baking it was due to the fact that I always felt like I could do better than dropping off store bought treats for my kids school parties, true story.  So, I started out making cookies from boxed cake mixes.  Once I realized that I was pretty stinkin’ good at cookie making AND that my kiddos really enjoyed being in the kitchen with me AND that I kinda liked the good stuff I was coming up with…..well, the rest is history.</p>
